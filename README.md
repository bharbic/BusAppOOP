Hello! This project was made for my OOP class.

Using Java as a base language and implementing JavaFX (formerly Swing) as a GUI library I created a small, offline bus ticket ordering app that is nearly feature complete, alongside some miniscule bugs I couldn't squash on time. I'm interested in continuing development on this app by redoing the infrastructure of the app itself and adding more functionality within the SQLite database I created. The database was mostly managed using SQLite DB Browser, with some work and debugging done within the JB IntelliJ GUI (thank you JetBrains for the dev pack!). This project was alot of fun despite it looking underwhelming at first; It actually made me realize that Java is something I really like and would put alot of effort into learning more than what is shown here.

Thank you for reading!
